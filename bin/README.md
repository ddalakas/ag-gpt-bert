# Tokenized Data Folder

This directory should contain the **tokenized `.bin` files** used for training, validation, and testing.

Each `.bin` file should correspond to the training, validation, or test set of the pretraining corpus. This can be done by running the `tokenize_corpus.py` file in the `tokenize_scripts` directory.
