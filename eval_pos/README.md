# PoS Tagging

This directory contains code for finetuning a GPT-BERT model on the task of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging.  
PoS tagging is divided into two tasks: Universal (UPoS) tagging and language-specific (XPoS) tagging.

A shell script is included for each task to run three finetuning experiments, each with a different random seed.

The GPT-BERT model implementation (with Hugging Face wrappers) is provided in `modeling_ltgbert.py`, and the configuration is defined in `configuration_ltgbert.py`. Both files are adapted from the official GPT-BERT Hugging Face repository: [link](https://huggingface.co/ltg/gpt-bert-babylm-base/tree/main).

Finetuning hyperparameters can be adjusted in the `upos-config.py` and `xpos-config.py` files, respectively.

**Note:** The path to the Hugging Face folder containing the model checkpoints must be specified in both `upos-config.py` and `xpos-config.py`. If you havenâ€™t already created a Hugging Face checkpoint folder for the model, use `convert_to_hf.py` to do so.
